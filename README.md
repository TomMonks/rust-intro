Note for learning rust

## Cargo

**Commands are the same no matter the OS**

* `cargo new hello_cargo`

Create a new dir called `hello_cargo`.  This contains a Cargo.toml (dependency management) `src/main.rs`

* `cargo build`

Creates an executable in target/debug/hello_cargo

* `cargo check`
  
Checks code compiles without build.  Faster when executable not needed.

* `cargo run`

Build and run a project in one step.

* `cargo build --release`
  
Optimised release build stored in `target/release`
